# Query String Parser

If multiple fields of the same name exist in a query string, every other web processing language would read them into an array, but PHP silently overwrites them ([source](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.parse-str.php#76792)). PSR-15 Middleware parse query string and keep duplicates in PSR7 URI Query.
